# swiftPortfolioApp
My first app working with SwiftUI. 

This is going to reflect my progress learning Swift on my own. Bring more Swift Dev classes to schools!!

I want to learn Swift because one day I will work for Apple. I want to know the ins and outs of Swift and all the packages that come along with it to make immaculate iOS apps.
